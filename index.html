    </a>
    <div class="desc"><i>Waves</i><div><p>This work combines various images: a seagull, a wave, and a lantern.  I used a variety of effects and overlays to distort the images, as I wanted to experiment with abstraction techniques.</p></div></div>

    <img src="sunburst.jpg" alt="sunflower image" width="3300px" height="2550px">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><i>Sunburst</i><div><p>This collage combines two nature images: a sunflower and a dandelion.  The reason I did this was to see what I could create by compiling plants and natural forms.</p></div></div>

    <img src="descent.jpg" alt="image of ice" width="3300px" height="2550px">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><i>Descent</i><div><p>This work combines two pictures: a lighthouse stairway and a cup of ice water.  I remember creating it since I wanted to complile non-related images and make them appear artistically similar.</p></div></div>

  <a target="_blank" href="vortex.jpg">
    <img src="vortex.jpg" alt="paper birds" width="3300px" height="2550px">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><i>Vortex</i><div><p>This piece combines various objects, such as a single paper crane and a glass sculpture.  I created it since I had seen other people create abstracted images and became inspired to try a similar method.</p></div></div>

  </a>
    <div class="desc"><i>Buzz</i><div><p>This project combines a few visuals from nature: a bee on a flower and a tree.  I created it since I was inspired to combine images of natural forms.</p></div></div>

  </a>
  <div class="desc"><i>Tahoe</i><div><p> I created this work, after a weekend in South Lake Tahoe. I used several images of things which I saw on that trip: sunglasses, seagulls, a mountain highway, and a pinecone.  My intention of creating this collage was to merge together several pictures of things from the Tahoe area.</p></div></div>

<div class="desc"><i>A Place Called Home</i><div><p>This experimental documentary captures one of my weekend trips to Sacramento.  It's a piece which has significant meaning for me since I lived in Sacramento, before moving to San Jose for school.</p></div></div>

<div class="desc"><i>Springtime Composite</i><div><p>I created this video by animating still objects- a lantern, a sunflower, and leaves- and compiling them with outdoor sounds.  My objective was to give the viewer a relaxed, Springtime feel.</p></div></div>
